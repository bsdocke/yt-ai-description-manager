#YouTube AI Description Manager
This project is a simple GUI application that allows you to generate YouTube descriptions for your local video files in bulk. It also provides a utility to bulk upload those same files and their descriptions to YouTube.

#Usage
The simplest way to get started (for Windows users) is to download one of the executable builds.
In the directory where you keep the .exe, create a client_secrets.json file and a settings.json file.

#client_secrets.json
This is where you'll need to store your credentials that allow you to upload videos to YouTube.
TODO - add instructions for how to do this in the Google Console

#settings.json
These are more like preferences, but do include your Gemini API key that you'll need for Description generation.
TODO - explain what you actually need here to get started, and where to get this key

#Running from source
TODO explain getting started with venv, what version of Python you'll need, etc... Not very different from what you'd need for running the executable
